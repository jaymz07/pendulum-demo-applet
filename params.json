{"name":"Pendulum-demo-applet","tagline":"Simulation applet for the wavy pendulum demo often seen in internet videos. 3D java applet.","body":"![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaymz07/pendulum-demo-applet/master/Pendulums.png)\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nPhysics simulation of a multiple pendulum setup often seen in physics exhibitions, science fairs, and youtube videos.\r\nPendulum lengths are chosen so that their periods of oscillations are integer multiples of some fundamental period, so that they seem to come back into phase after some integer number of these fundamental periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nTo compile using the make system, simply run in the project directory:\r\n\r\n  make\r\n\r\nIf the make system is not installed, you can use the JDK directly:\r\n\r\n  javac Pendulums.javac\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaunch\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to launch the applet is to use a compatible browser and open the \"RunPendulumDemo.html\" file.\r\nOtherwise, if your system's PATH variable points to the JDK binaries, then you can simply launch using:\r\n\r\n  appletviewer RunPendulumDemo.html\r\n\r\n\r\nInternals\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis applet does not use any external libraries other than the built in 2D java graphics. The 2D java graphics has been manually adapted to produce 3D looking pictures. This is rather slow in terms of hardware acceleration since only 2D acceleration is used.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
